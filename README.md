# Portofolio-Project-with-DQLab

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and subscription churn on Spotify in 2025. The analysis uses datasets sourced from Kaggle, which are processed through merging and data cleaning using SQL and Python. The final insights are visualized with Google Looker to provide actionable business recommendations.


To provide actionable insights, an interactive dashboard was developed to monitor churn trends and user behavior.
